## Project Title

Monte Carlo Simulation

## Getting Started

Monte Carlo methods are essentially algorithms to utilize randomness to solve problems by _brute force_ methods. They are commonly used when it's difficult to model a situation using other pure mathematical approaches. They give us the possibility to test multiple outcome possibilities. This is possible because all outcomes have _in theory_ a finite possibility to occur.

With respect to finance, Monte Carlo simulations can be used to evaluate investments and risk analysis. This project is done just for that.

#Consider this gambling scenario:
Where a user can roll a dice for an outcome of 1-100.
* If the user rolls a number between 1-50 the "house" wins
* If the user rolls a number between 51-99 the user wins
* If the user rolls a 100, the "house" wins

With this, the house holds a mere 1% edge over the long run. We can first create our __Simple Bettor__. His role is basically to bet a set amount each and every time. If he wins he will bet _x_ amount. If he loses, he will bet _x_ amount. Notice how his bet is independent of the result of the previous result.

Alternatively we can create a __better bettor__ that actually utilizes a martingale betting strategy to improve his odds at winning. We can have two versions of him/her.The first iteration of our would be utilizing a simple double betting strategy. If he loses the previous round, he will be _2x_ based upon the previous wager until he wins.

The second iteration is our __multiple bettor__. He is where we can pull in a monte carlo simulation to actual determine the best multiple we can utilize to maximize the profit one makes and minimize the given risk that they could go broke, thus losing. If he loses the previous round, he will bet _y(x)_ amount based upon the previous wager amount. This _y_ multiple is determined by our simulation because we can simulation numerous worlds where the best multiple can be determined. _Important_: We are utilizing the result of the result of our __bettor bettor__ as a benchmark to determine if we did better.

## Results

Given the preset odds of the game space, its understandable that the __simple bettor__ is going to fail. It's just a question of how long. Over a long enough time horizon, all players utilizing this strategy will go broke. It's fairly easy to visualize as well:

![Simple_bettor]("https://github.com/jaredconnor301/Monte_Carlo_Sim/blob/master/simple_bettor.png?raw=true")

The results of our __better bettor__ improves quite a bit. We can incorporate an functionality that breaks the bettor off after they go broke. Visualizing the results of multiple simulations of this kind of bettor gives us a vastly different understanding of the game space.

![Double_bettor]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredconnor301/Monte_Carlo_Sim/master/double_bettor.png")

We can visualize that utilizing the martingale strategy changes the aspect of risk that we should care about. In the short run multiple player actually make quite a bit more than the __simple bettor__ but assumably assumed more risk. Over the long run, the simulation life is substantially higher, but what comes into question is the _life expectancy_ of the bettors.

We can generate general statistics that we can utilize as a benchmark for the next simulation we'll run. The __double bettor__ simulation yielded us these stats:

#Bust rate (the rate at attrition): 31.325
#Profit rate (rate which bettors earn a profit): 63.208

Now is where the fun comes. By utilizing these statistics, we can run multiple world simulations by adjusting the multiple (remember the _y(x)_) to maximize these statistics.

![Multiple_bettor]("https://github.com/jaredconnor301/Monte_Carlo_Sim/blob/master/Results.png?raw=true")

So we can see that the best multiple is .4432 and yields the stats of:

# Bust rate: 8
# Profit rate: 28900.00

## TD;DL
We simulated a Martingale Betting strategy with a Monte_Carlo_Sim to find the bettor can maximize risk adjusted returns by betting .4432 of the previous bet.
